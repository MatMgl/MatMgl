### Hi there! 👋 I'm Mateusz

## 🧠 About Me

I'm a mathematician with a Master's degree and a strong interest in data analysis, statistics, and statistical hypothesis testing.  
I enjoy exploring data, drawing meaningful insights, and building tools using **R** and **Python**.

You'll often find me working on projects that involve statistical reasoning, modeling, and automation through code.
